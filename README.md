Simulates Adriatic Sea bathymetry and ocean currents using stochastic methods. Loads and visualizes depth data, generates a velocity field, and simulates particle trajectories with Euler-Maruyama integration. Includes contour and vector field plots for better analysis. Ideal for ocean modeling and marine simulations. ðŸš¢
